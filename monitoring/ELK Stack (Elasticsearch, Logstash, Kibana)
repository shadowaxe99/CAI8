// Install and configure Elasticsearch
// Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases.
// It provides real-time search, distributed search, analytics, and more.
// For more information, refer to the Elasticsearch documentation.

// Install Elasticsearch using a package manager or download it from the official website.
// Configure Elasticsearch by modifying the elasticsearch.yml file.

// File: elasticsearch.yml

cluster.name: my-application
node.name: node-1
path.data: /path/to/data
path.logs: /path/to/logs
network.host: 0.0.0.0
http.port: 9200

// Start Elasticsearch by running the elasticsearch command.

// Install and configure Logstash
// Logstash is an open-source data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to a desired destination.
// It can be used to collect, parse, and transform logs, metrics, and other data.

// Install Logstash using a package manager or download it from the official website.
// Create a Logstash configuration file to define the input, filter, and output plugins.

// File: logstash.conf

input {
  # Define your input plugin here
}

filter {
  # Define your filter plugin here
}

output {
  # Define your output plugin here
}

// Start Logstash by running the logstash command with the configuration file.

// Install and configure Kibana
// Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool for Elasticsearch.
// It provides a web interface for querying, analyzing, and visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch.

// Install Kibana using a package manager or download it from the official website.
// Configure Kibana by modifying the kibana.yml file.

// File: kibana.yml

server.port: 5601
server.host: "localhost"
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

// Start Kibana by running the kibana command.

// Access the Kibana web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5601 in your web browser.

// You have now set up the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time monitoring and analytics.
// Customize the configuration files and plugins according to your specific requirements.
